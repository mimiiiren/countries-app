==================================
🧠 VERSION 2 PSEUDO-CODE WORKSHEET
==================================

This is our WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, HOW framework for working with data:

1. WHAT data should we store & retrieve?
   What kind of HTTP request do we need to send, and to what API endpoint?
   If we are sending a POST request, what do we need to send in the request body, and what is the data type?
   What would we get back in the response, and what is the data t ype?

2. WHEN should we store & retrieve the data?
   What event or user action is the trigger, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or loading a page?

3. WHERE does this happen in the code?
   What component, page or function?

4. HOW do we accomplish this?
   What steps do we need to take?
   Do we need to...
   - make any GET or POST requests to an API endpoint?
   - render anything in JSX?
   - make any functions? If so, when would we call those functions?
   - use any useState or useEffect hooks?
     Remember: This is pseudo-code. Don't write code yet — just outline the actions in plain language.

✨ YOUR TASK: Fill in the answers to each WHAT/WHEN/WHERE/HOW question below for the 3 pieces of data.

==================================
📊 FORM DATA
==================================

========================
🔶 STORING FORM DATA
========================

}

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: string
RESPONSE: Success! User has been added.

❓ WHEN: user fills out form

❓ WHERE: savedCountries page

❓ HOW:
Step 1: user fills out form and submits
Step 2: async function to fetch from api endpoint with post method and request body

Add more steps as needed!

========================
🔶 RETRIEVING FORM DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): GET
API ENDPOINT: /get-newest-user

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): N/A
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): N/A

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: ARRAY OF OBJECTS
RESPONSE: [
  {
    "user_id": 42,
    "name": "John Smith",

  }
]

❓ WHEN: App.jsx page loads

❓ WHERE: savedCountries page loads

❓ HOW:
Step 1: user fills and submits form
Step 2: create async function getNewestUserData that uses fetch() to send GET request
to /get-newest-user endpoint. save to state var newestUserData
Step 3: useEffect to call getNewestUserData() on page load
Step 4: render newest users name to screen in JSX

📊 SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
===================================

========================
🔶 STORING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
API ENDPOINT: /save-one-country

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): object
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): 
{
  "country_name": "Brazil"
}

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: string
RESPONSE: Success! The country is saved.

❓ WHEN: After user clicks save button on CountryDetail Page

❓ WHERE: CountryDetail Page

❓ HOW:
Step 1: user clicks save button
Step 2: onClick function for button to send post request to api with country_name in request body 
Step 3: api stores saved country_name as object
Add more steps as needed!

========================
🔶 RETRIEVING SAVED COUNTRIES DATA
========================

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): GET
API ENDPOINT: /get-all-saved-countries

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): N/A
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): N/A

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: array of objects
RESPONSE: 
[
  {
    "country_name": "Japan"
  },
  {
    "country_name": "Germany"
  }
]

❓ WHEN: user clicks Saved Countries on top right corner

❓ WHERE: SavedCountries page

❓ HOW:
Step 1: user clicks saved countries page
Step 2: async function with get method to fetch saved countries array from api. store 
in state variable savedCountries array
Step 3: map through savedCountries and find country_name that matches countries array name.common property
Step 4: render the savedCountries array as country cards to savedCountries page above the form element

=================================
📊 COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
=================================

========================
🔶 STORING & RETRIEVING COUNTRY COUNTS DATA
========================
NOTE: We combine storing & retrieving country counts data into one section because they always happen together. Each time we look up a country’s view count, we also need to increase it and save the new total.

❓ WHAT...
TYPE OF HTTP REQUEST (GET OR POST): POST
API ENDPOINT: /update-one-country-count

REQUEST BODY DATA TYPE (if applicable): object
REQUEST BODY (if applicable): 
{
  "country_name": "France"
}

RESPONSE DATA TYPE: object
RESPONSE: 
{
  "count": 3
}

❓ WHEN: user clicks a country card

❓ WHERE: CountryDetail page

❓ HOW:
Step 1: create state variable count to track each time user clicks on a country card
Step 2: create async function with POST method and request body with country_name 
Step 3: create increaseCount function for when user clicks into countryCard, increase value of count by 1
Step 4: render value of state variable count on CountryDetail page
